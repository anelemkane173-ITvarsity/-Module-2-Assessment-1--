                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.Monkeys tend to inhabit the tropical rainforests of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. All primates live in trees, with the exception of baboons that prefer to live on the ground.</p>
<p>Monkeys are arranged into two main groups: Old World and New World. Old World monkeys all belong to one family, Cercopithecidae, which is related to apes and humans, and together they are classified as catarrhines.They have a lifespan of 20 years and above.All species of monkeys have opposable thumbs just like humans. Monkeys live both on the ground and in trees. Monkeys that spend their entire lives in trees are called arboreal. A group of monkeys is referred to as a mission, tribe, or troop.</p>
 <p>Monkeys as smart as TODDLERS: Scientists say apes can understand abstract properties. Monkeys are as smart as a three-year-old child when it comes to solving puzzles. Capuchins, chimpanzees and bonobos were able to pull a piece of string after watching how it released a food reward</p>
