                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
<p>Koalas are mammals, and they have round, fuzzy ears and look cute and cuddly, like a teddy bear. But koalas are not bears. They are members of a group of pouched mammals called marsupials. Marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, wombats, possums, and opossums. Koalas look soft, but their fur feels like the coarse wool of a sheep. They also seem cuddly, but koalas are not tame, and they don't make good pets. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae.They have a lifespan of 13-18 years in the wild.Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. When not sleeping, they're usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food. Koalas can eat more than a pound of eucalyptus leaves a day.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E50, right next to the gorillas.</p>
