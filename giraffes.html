                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! Its closest relative is the okapi. Giraffes have a small hump on their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard.</p>
<p> Giraffes are well adapted to a life in a savannah. They drink water when it is available but can go weeks without it, they rely on morning dew and the water content of their food. Their very long necks are an adaption to feeding at high levels in the treetops.They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to sometimes fight with other males.</p>
 <p>A giraffeâ€™s spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same pattern.</p>
