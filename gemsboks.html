                    <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
<p>The gemsbok is the largest antelope in the genus Oryx from the kingdom Animalia It is one of the best desert-adapted large mammals, capable of surviving in waterless wastelands where many animals would perish. It is second only to the addax in this regard.Its maximum running speed is 60 km/h,a male maximum mass is 220-300 kg whereas a female is 100-210kg.Gemsbok have a horse-like posture and gallop and have muscular necks and shoulders. They have a long tail with black flowing hair. Both male and female gemsbok have long, sharp, pointed horns (female horns are longer and more slender). These horns can extend up to 33 inches in height.</p>
<p>Gemsboks are herbivores and grazers and consume mainly tough dry grasses, supplemented with foliage.The gemsbok often grazes at night when plants have higher moisture content. It is usually inactive for most of the day. Gemsbok are highly nomadic in the desert, but where there are watering holes or a good supply of water-bearing vegetation, herds may remain year-round in smaller home ranges, within which bulls defend territories.</p>
 <p>Gemsbok are also found in wooded grasslands, as well as wetter grasslands. They can survive in areas of low productivity. Gemsbok prefer stony plains with at least limited water access, but can subsist in areas of dunes, rocky mountainous areas, and arid habitats with little seasonal water. Gemsbok frequent open areas more than areas with increased tree density.</p>
