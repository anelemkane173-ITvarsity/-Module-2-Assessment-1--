                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
<p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates.They are from the family Hominidae and they have the lifespan of 35-40 years</p>
<p>The gorilla is one of the closest living relatives to humans,both groups last shared a DNA of 98%.Gorillas stick to a mainly vegetarian diet, feeding on stems, bamboo shoots and fruits. Western lowland gorillas, however, also have an appetite for termites and ants, and break open termite nests to eat the larvae.They are one the biggest most powerful living primates</p>
 <p>They have a huge appetite and 16 different types of call this includes short barks when they are midly alarmed or curious.To intimidate rivals, male gorillas strut with stiff legs, beat their chests, and use vocalisations like roars or hoots. </p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E49, right next to the forest.</p>
