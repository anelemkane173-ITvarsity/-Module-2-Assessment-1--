                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
<p>Ailuropoda melanoleuca is a giant panda from the kingdom Animal,phylum Chordata,class Mammalia and family Ursidae
also known as the panda bear. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim </p>
 <p>Bamboo is critical to their diet.Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in south central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.Pandas can live a long time in cold areas because their fur can produce heat to the body.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at the panda canyon, right next to the coffee shop.</p>
